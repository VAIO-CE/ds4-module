# DS4 Module Development

This is the code base for VAIO's DS4 module. Code will be merged into main repository later on.

## Setup
Go to `Preferences > Additional board manager URLs` and add the following two boards:
### ESP32 by Espressif Systems
```
https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
```
### Bluepad32 for ESP32
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardoquesada/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/master/bluepad32_files/package_esp32_bluepad32_index.json
```

And then, go to `Board Manager` tab and install the latest versions of:
1. esp32 by Espressif Systems
2. esp32_bluepad32 by Ricardo Quesada

You're good to go!
